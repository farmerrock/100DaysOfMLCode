# 100 Days Of ML Code

### Day 0: Jan 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
So excited that today I start my 100 Day of ML Code Challenge. I create github for recording all my AI study and storing all teaching materials for later use. 
Also I created the jupyter notebook for lesson 1 for Google Colab and run successfully FINALLY. Continue study of fast.ai lesson 3 and set up ubuntu inside windows 10 for running testing code locally.

**Thoughts:** The fast.ai MOOC material only works on v0.7. Better find a more interesting topics for teaching instead of cats and dogs. Also GAN is a attractive topics for demo to student, need more study on that.
