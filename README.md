# 100 Days Of ML Code

### Day 0: Jan 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- So excited that today I start my 100 Day of ML Code Challenge. I create github for recording all my AI study and storing all teaching materials for later use. 
- Also I created the jupyter notebook for lesson 1 for Google Colab and run successfully FINALLY. 
- Continue study of fast.ai lesson 3 and set up ubuntu inside windows 10 for running testing code locally.

**Thoughts:** 
- The fast.ai MOOC material only works on v0.7. 
- Better find a more interesting topics for teaching instead of cats and dogs. 
- GAN is a attractive topics for demo to student, need more study on that.

### Day 1: Jan 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Preparing for the lesson note of first lesson for school of AI.

**Thoughts:** 
- Need further explaination of the basic machine learning knowledge and train/validation set in the first class.
- The first homework can be training Labradoodle Or Fried Chicken.
